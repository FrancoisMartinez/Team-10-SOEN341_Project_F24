# **Peer Review Application** 

 **Function:**

This web application is designed to allow students to give feedback on their teammates after or during a group assignment based on many factors including contribution, participation, communication, etc. Teachers and teachers' assistants will also be given access to view the comments of the different groups in order to mark each student fairly. 

Each students will be prompted to rate their peers anonymously based on the following factors:

- **Cooperation**: Each member actively participates in meetings and communicates with the rest of the team often. They show their cooperation by offering their help and by volunteering for new tasks.
- **Conceptual Contribution**: Actively participates in the completion of the project by researching technologies, exploring potential pathways and providing quality individual contribution.
- **Practical Contribution**: In addition to the conceptual part, members also need to actively participate in the documentation of the project. Writing, reviewing and providing feedback to reports is a must when working on a group project.
- **Work Ethics**: Students show respect towards their peers and the deadlines imposed.

Each of these points are graded on a scale from 1 to 7. Teachers will receive each individual scores at the end of the review period. Students will also be able to see the reviews given to them anonymously for them to find ways to improve themselves.

Instructors will be given access to a detailed dashboard allowing them to create and edit teams, view detailed peer assessments, and export the data to CVS files.
